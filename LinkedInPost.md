# LinkedIn Post: ChatCal.ai v0.3.4 - Secret Manager OAuth Persistence

🚀 **Major Breakthrough in ChatCal.ai v0.3.4!**

Just solved a critical production challenge that many cloud developers face: **OAuth token persistence across container restarts**.

## 🔧 The Problem
Our AI-powered calendar booking assistant ran on Google Cloud Run, but OAuth tokens expired every 15 minutes when containers restarted. Users constantly had to re-authenticate, breaking the user experience.

## 💡 The Solution  
Implemented **Google Cloud Secret Manager integration** with a sophisticated multi-tier storage architecture:

🔐 **Primary**: Secret Manager (persistent across restarts)  
⚡ **Cache**: In-memory storage (container lifetime performance)  
🔄 **Fallbacks**: Redis and local file storage

## 🎯 Results
✅ **Zero authentication interruptions** - users stay logged in  
✅ **Seamless Google Meet booking** - tested end-to-end  
✅ **Production-ready** - survives Cloud Run's 15-minute lifecycle  
✅ **Automatic token refresh** - handles expired access tokens  

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- Integrated `google-cloud-secret-manager` v2.24.0
- Multi-tier credential caching for optimal performance  
- Comprehensive OAuth debug logging and error handling
- Semantic versioning with proper CI/CD practices
- Full test coverage including container restart scenarios

## 💼 Business Impact
No more frustrated users losing their authentication mid-workflow. The AI assistant now provides **uninterrupted calendar scheduling** for business consultations and meetings.

**Key Learning**: Sometimes the biggest user experience improvements come from solving infrastructure challenges that users never see but always feel.
